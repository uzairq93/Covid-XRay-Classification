#### Implementing From Scratch
We don't plan to implement any models from scratch. We will be using models available on the web (github). We expect we will have to modify these models slightly, but our plan is to modify the models we use from github as little as possible.


#### Updated Desired Goals
- We will conduct a thorough comparative study on the time complexity of different models when working on this covid-19 dataset. Specifically, we will be comparing which model is more "time efficient", or has a better tradeoff on training time and performance.
- We will also conduct a throrough comparative study on the effect of pretraining on each model to see whether pretraining improves the model's performance or its training time/performance trade off. We will further investigate whether pretraining on specifically medical images makes pretraining more effective or beneficial to the model's performance and/or training time/performance trade off.


#### Data Augmentation
We will use basic image data augmentation methods to increase the robustness of our tranining. We would pick one or two from the following example , Scaling, Cropping, Flipping, Padding, Rotation, Translation.
