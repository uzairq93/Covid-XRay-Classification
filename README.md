# CS 449 Final Project
Uzair Qadir and Ian Cramer were primarily responsible for the VGG model training
The project has three main pieces:

- your proposal in `proposal.ipynb`, due February 1
- your project update in `update.ipynb`, due February 24
- your final report in `report.ipynb`, due March 13

The final_report.ipynb is the final report juypter notebook file that we will be submitting.

The ResNet&Baseline.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file that contains the self-built CNN classifier and the image classification model using ResNet as backbone.

The vgg.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file that contains image classification model using VGG as backbone.

The vit_with_pretrain.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file that contains image classification model using visual transformer.
